# mece-788-project-1
Winter 2021 - MECE 788 Project

We intend to use technical indicators to predict stock prices.

* Install conda if you do not have it: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
* Then create a new virtual environment by using the requirement file. You can do this opening your terminal and navi
gating to the project directory. Then using this command: 'conda env create -f environment.yml'
* This will create a new virtual environment, activate it and then use 'jupyter lab' command to open a jupyter session.
* Open the regression_notebook.ipynb from the jupyter session. You can then run all the cells sequentially to regenerate the results we achieved.
* Please note that our environment was based on windows os so there might be some compatibility issues when using another os with the dependencies.
